                <p class="title"><b>The Inspiration</b></p>
                <p>The first diary I ever kept started in second grade, and even after the class assignment was 
                    done, I continued writing in it. All my life, writing has been the only imperative, and I am
                    my own favorite subject. If I understand myself, maybe I can understand the world. I decided
                    to start typing up these diaries for lots of reasons: because I trusted a digital record 
                    more than the physical one I had, so I could put my old journals in storage and still 
                    remember what I had written, because a part of me believed something I had to say at twelve 
                    years old might one day be worth being read by someone else. But in my sixth year of 
                    attempting an undergraduate degree in computer science while skipping my homework to write
                    stories and poems, I realized that my diaries are not just stories or records or inspiration,
                    they are data. I'm not a good enough coder to make the computer make any sense of that data,
                    but I hope I'm a good enough poet to make sense of the computer's gibberish.
                </p>

                <p class="title"><b>The Project</b></p>
                <p>I used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to train an AI on my old diary entries using tutorials 
                    from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/stephen-king-text-generation-with-artificial-intelligence-rnn-using-python-e92c735851be">https://towardsdatascience.com/stephen-king-text-generation-with-artificial-intelligence-rnn-using-python-e92c735851be</a> 
                    and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation">https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation</a>. For each diary, I trained an 
                    AI model, then provided input based on common words or phrases in those diaries 
                    (from <a href="https://wordcounter.net/">https://wordcounter.net/</a> and also my own knowledge of how I write) to generate text, 
                    occasionally taking interesting phrases generated as a new input. I saved any promising 
                    looking generated entries and turned them into poems, converting gibberish into similar 
                    looking or sounding words, or deleting it entirely. 
                </p>

                <p class="title"><b>The Result</b></p>
                <p>Part reflection of the past, part poetic Rorschach test in the present, and part absurd 
                    gibberish, here’s a look into whether a poorly trained AI can lend any insights into life.
