Dear Diary,
Why

I want to rot 
this meadow, here I  float 
item felt there, the flowers
I know a snowier one, burnt

because wonder, because I’m overeager 
and  some easy accolade of youth 
I’m emerging. I visit oaths I just want. 
I make this hill beneath summer

because I can be  the wind, on me the wind
l  have some that I won’t make 
belt the  armed and the  dammed, and that some that I want 
be held

know 
that I want to be held, you that I can 
I won’t bleed

I want to be the same 
be held alone that I won’t be held with the  arms
that I’m so safe in
the hands that I am safe

know in November,
I want tomorrow, I want your song
go 
Make some loaf 

lover, I was to be injected
be touched.
write why does something I want to win 
commencing feel like that

I love today
the chute I messed it up
I wait to be the same tomorrow
what about home

Dear Diary, love people. 
And I change, 
and I know they do best. I guess healing lies  with death,
wonder what she and I most

Dear Diary,
I want
I won’t need to be here 
thing in the tea, I was to the sea-lion,
shot me in February, tomorrow

how much would I chose to be
peridot, I mean, I mean, 
I want to gate,
to be near in the serration

next year, so lava,
these things are good and free 
I had to be love   and realized
love  

come back in my dreams because
    I was today open, a
way to answer , let me soar. 
A droll retelling being best friends, 
I think

Scituate with fire
    and she’s left a friend, 
be left because I’m foam, wanted, 
she coughs so I too am leaving land
a porch swing, tree, always two Ali,
and then
