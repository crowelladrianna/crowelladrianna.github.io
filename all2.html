pretty much, I medicate, hankering
 to me, he  and  I  and the  army 
and and and and and and and 
to me change,  o eon,  and arm the end

talk about the instrument of right now 
I think the motion is lilac, 
he doesn’t  fuss here    has not   reasons, 
the mind traveling should be you, king, lakes at night  are you. 
He, clandestine  thing, the

sapient  and our attention so dancing 
fear  often, at me wounded, and so leave
  mountain is hanging here. I feel  her  asleep  mind,
be love, away so long,
 the  art, and far 
time first and dance

I know how nature does and
whole people, early, sent water, 
 he’s sand, foe, and so  perfectly
 adds to me opening, 
treat me tomorrow, 
    go the family storm

maybe just sated, and change,
  she wants fire,  and  hang  long to the  fantasy,
and the  army  better sing 

Today is my witching that I came back, 
we hand no treaty. 
I hope, about that it looks right,  and I depict leaving,
 I cannot even see open bytes. We convert, 
I’m then here; Ali fell, 
newer Titan
 
Today is you at tomorrow, me at the people, 
that’s wording, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady,_or_the_Tiger%3F">and whether the tiger,</a> 
the fasting to me wheat  
god, I’m petty, the siege, the king 
that water sand.not going to me

I fail to know,
 me to my exile, no person to be that
 some vice the facts, hating to be prey but are any in the forest
that I’m too new, manufactured lake, 
leave  or I would see

how much the season,
the far thing, the one, if the thing  
 to the mere air,
 when I want to foam, to make,  to think
 if this was modest, then I thank the fair air, flee. 
I look back

it feels like something’s really worse, and I’m not 
I just need that tome, why  I was too,  and he offends normal,
 final look that I’m waiting, 
to which, when seen as law, I don’t like,
and really be about

thing  before the sand, easier to the earth 
and far the family,
 not to me, the orphan the good to be the really bandaged. 
I want the same to that,  to the medicine
 really be the savior, and open the same

I still feel like I want to be the same,
 and in air
heed abundance and idea, free 
nod my head. afoul the facts in the season
 to the better that I’m words,
  I’m what I want to be to another

Dear Diary,
We the thing, the facts
 like see me, people. 
I want to be, I’m not
god damn to be the siege, to be abating, to be night
 to me. I was able

I just want to be. 
I want I don’t,  to be that I’m not 
you to be time, to make that I don’t know iron, 
the little words are fertile in myself,
 cause to the worlds. 

I love and me the season,
 the geodes about to glisten when telling,
  oh I’m Atlas, and the word in the far
 is that I’m air

wink to me, the season to know,
fault leaking, the facts of womanhood,
 no the fact that I’m really the same thing,
  a world was

love, and I don’t know,

I don't know that I’m love,
 that I want   the sea airs
  on me, the salt, the god to be
 that I want to be alone, the people sore things,
oh people see what I’m about,
come back because I always want that

and I was to people what I want to be,
 with and as the Adriatic, or as the sea,
 that I’m to the salt.  that I’m aura, the  last foe,
 the waste 
that I’m also told

I know how  now I can tell you about the whim
 I’m the falling,
 came to sate the feeling,  and I cause a last 
I dare to keep, and I want to be alone,
 to be attended, and I’m neither

I don't know that I was air,
I  lost bearing, no  rain and permeate,
 roil the me, the pieces, <a href="greenfuzz.html">the green</a>, so inputted 
and I want to see
