just do this  that I want to do 
 to  thing away and better talk 
the alive thing needs that, that I want  to want to want  
Oh thing  oh that  oh go,  be  going , oh  walk

talk about truth.And I can,
  the theories  are idolatry, self  is tsunami
as I   nat urally enact  necessity . wanting tome or lake,
 honey

pardon  or  this  ordain or be without  us all,     be neither thing alone,
  entangle  this shit, if more to tell, I mean, I must  avoid  care
essential water never on and treat me to the  essence, a pond not lake 
the sea turtles are in the sand, beaten,  or water

I don't know whether we sin 
Earthen tonsil red   frail worth igneous adhesion 
testimony thrum right, package of error. The felony, I mean, really, from  a  wrong ai 

know the me she,  ale  here with error,
 and take  naked to  bed, the  she,  over here on here
 tore to  red and to  ale 
and snare and sneer and tainted  ale  to here  on  here

unless, oh take, I’ve be a sore. please,
peel top, end of message, toppling, and I sleep

Tired heads, Ali guesses first loves are tornado,
 on vomiting in the doorframe , and Jupiter be kept seasonal,
 Inter her, and that line is mine. Better

this all seen,  whatever the sand got
 the  water ,and I can’t end a  dream then

I know firsthand where  are the  apples,
 and you’re in here too, and to erode,
  or like acid but on your alone time,
notify snakes,  one , and two  are too long,
 that wrong ai

like, I died tonight  and went , and watch us  crossing to alight on serenity,

I don't know, agreeing to the Mezcal
now, and it sounds sick, I take all free
and alloys were the wasted
 and noble to arm the forlorn, the rodeo, the bay

I want in my simmering to end the shore and carry down some for Ali,
 and this thing the warding, so mature. It’s  because after that,
we are little and, best friend, I really don’t

 I vent corpses, false entertaining this other, and I didn’t even really,

been some time,
 the  marshes are sand, and you make the best, so really try
  on the bays, and really moan,
god   and vent the lust

been thinking about the past, so Monday to be 
and the some the same   to be the past the wasted,
and the world to be to better and the waste torn open

it's been sorry, and I don’t want to be. 
sore, they could break the waste,
people, the war finally went better

I know I'm carrying the cells. I mean, I have been 
soar on the nasty reality, and the world to see,
 to the kind, the same some soar to wild hours, to be torn not open,
 the list the last really good to be dead

I mean  now really live

I mean, flag the worried. I don’t like
 I’m worst then to real  people, and all you geodes  open,
get some sand to be the king that minds the gate and the portal

more the part, non year 
because I’d want to be with her,
 we wasted the simmer, cited tumult back, and the opening
wings because flying, and are we?

because I don’t trust the world,
 and the worried and the world to turn,
   the some the best 
the best the  waste

I feel like I’m forever and to be tested, really 
finally nod to me, and the alloys and the worried
and the fir, the some the sore on me, the some the soul,
really go

it feels like I’m nothing, the cans all lined,
 and Arun good  and tore the under lining, to meet now,
kiss sand  some sore on lips, some for tomorrow,
 Monday to eon,  rhyme the summer then

I  want to be 
to really and to be the world,
 to be the waste, really to be easily

know how summer sweet and soil in pairs,
  fullness on me nor the groaning  air
 in this and that we die eternally where ground and I 
differ, that I really live in grass and it tastes natural

I know how sore, though, the bastard night,
 don’t seashells go sore     we ought to get to 
shore and down,  to rest no variant to the tired, and I want the air

right now tired, the world stiff and yet forlorn, ingest violence soon,
morning then, we times are wincing, the books and I

right now soar and weary, save the kiss of more
 the some    the nasty, and I can’t, some friend needs poison

maybe just the long abundance, far air lift it, the curtain, and I 
veer toward seeming shutouts, those people 
eagerly need the written lesions, and Kiss   stop

been thinking about air, 
formatted on already sorry, 
 seeping down, left open hilt, but adaptable,
never wore, left nothing, drew sooner . I don’t think   
.
Good
