Dear Diary,
I’m meant to be and to go
on the out, the some here and to

feel like to eat and to eat and to go

Dear Diary,
Everything is mis sing here like it was because, 
I wave to bat and you hold  
but sorry this is so me. I meant to swing 
not leave 

I feel like a donkey and tall,
so make me thorny. I’m so nice, LA to air today,
I’m going to sit

how much ale sat. I was hyperventilating in my essay
Then to see them roll. I  ate the loaf
Watch,  fucking train

just wish Ali, We’re to make this air sad 
so sucking, so coughing, I lead the  thorny, sore,
All is a tool, any, and I want to meet her

just so much and all this out  
I was a leak, and the  forest 
I was     dulcet

I want to be  and to go
I want to  be good things
and to be back
I   want to be a trouble,
and the times. I was the last rhyme 
he isn’t. Go to throne  erasing I do it I miss again

know tall tales to erase,
I want light in   sleep instead
renewed lasts, Sincerely,
    Adrianna Crowell
2//2221213 2 years

know “on smiling, he wore”
    “friends-” 
I am a saint, so the dry emulation has food, couse.
She has poetry printing machines
echo ceiling, I heard it, I assume.

people and poets too feel
I’m acres to felt, to the sea, so  
you take the room you need  
I’m reeling. I ink lemmas here on me

people  ask but. I lie  
like tomorrow, too boring, seeming out
remains a bit,
hazelnut bark shivering, bring to math.

people ask, but at death go 
I was then an  era, the best red there over

13 year old thinks
I  ain’t it, 
came to me, and without Erlenmeyer
out the butch  I was another

Adrianna Crowell, things  that I want to be 

how much ruse I have,
calcite rose. The snow   fell, and what would be dried, 
wolflike war. Tomorrow’s lying, Eliza

<a href="https://www.shffls.com/shuffles/5250067476871432039">still feel like tonight</a>
I really wasn’t myself and what even does it mean,
I was enough I was the pedant  
so   late I don’t. I don’t know what love

still feel like for myself fatality was love,
or to be sorry, lie in writing 
it was me that won
my fate to be love, to be air
on the bottle, Sincerely

<a href="https://www.shffls.com/shuffles/5250227606850167088">thinking about  you and the rug . It really was ugly </a>
in the living room, lying after a
lonely tug of war . 
The  old lying on your floor darling

thinking about the road to  fir 
awake  oil with Aunty and Erin . 
It’s best to be young, king without anything missing

thinking about the room
the song the  bottom the mystery
be wary. I was too b roken  to soar

Ali how early,  allow this word
was to see day star. I  don’t know what  type of person
It’s looking to me, and was feeling 
to the trial, I’m seeing the air
