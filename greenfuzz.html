                    Dear Diary,<br>
                    Everything is mis sing here like it was because, <br>
                    I wave to bat and you hold  <br>
                    but sorry this is so me. I meant to swing <br>
                    not leave <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel like a donkey and tall,<br>
                    so make me thorny. I’m so nice, LA to air today,<br>
                    I’m going to sit<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    how much ale sat. I was hyperventilating in my essay<br>
                    Then to see them roll. I  ate the loaf<br>
                    Watch,  fucking train<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    just wish Ali, We’re to make this air sad <br>
                    so sucking, so coughing, I lead the  thorny, sore,<br>
                    All is a tool, any, and I want to meet her<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    just so much and all this out  <br>
                    I was a leak, and the  forest <br>
                    I was     dulcet<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be  and to go<br>
                    I want to  be good things<br>
                    and to be back<br>
                    I   want to be a trouble,<br>
                    and the times. I was the last rhyme <br>
                    he isn’t. Go to throne  erasing I do it I miss again<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    know tall tales to erase,<br>
                    I want light in   sleep instead<br>
                    renewed lasts, Sincerely,<br>

                    hazelnut bark shivering, bring to math.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    people ask, but at death go <br>

                    The  old lying on your floor darling <br>               
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
